## what is javascript?

- **what is javascript?**
  - JavaScript is a high-level, just-in-time compiled programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
  - JavaScript is a synchronous, blocking, single-threaded programming language.
  - **Synchronous**: code execution is line by line
  - **Blocking:** No matter how long a previous process takes, the subsequent processes won't kick off until the former is completed.
  - **Single-threaded.** A thread is simply a process that your JavaScript program can use to run a task.
    - Each thread can only do one task at a time.
    - JavaScript has just one thread, called the main thread, for executing any code.

## Variable Naming/identifier Rules

- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter.
- Names can also begin with $ and \_ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
- **Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).**
- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
- variable name best practice
  - use camelcase
  - human-readable
  - The name should be match the use cause
